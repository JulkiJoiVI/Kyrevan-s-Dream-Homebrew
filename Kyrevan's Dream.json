Their bodies are in a constant state of flow, appearing to be made of viscous, ever-shifting blood. Despite their lack of bones, they maintain a humanoid shape through sheer magical force. Their fluid nature grants them a range of liquid-like abilities, making them unique among constructs and undead."

As part of their dark arts, they used the blood of their slaves to create the Blood Golems, intended as tireless guardians for their crypts and catacombs.",

After the extinction of the vampire lords, many Blood Golems were left to wander the forgotten catacombs they once guarded, continuing their eternal vigil with no masters to command them."

Without a will of their own, they are driven solely by the magical compulsion to guard and protect the locations they were set to watch over."
